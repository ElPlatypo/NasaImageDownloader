# NasaImageDownloader

![img](img/iss.jpg)

This python script is meant for cloning the huge image database at https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/, the main usage of this is to download image sequences taken within few seconds of eachother to compile timelapses.
It will first download the images metadata only and compile it inside a pandas dataframe to allow fast searches later.
